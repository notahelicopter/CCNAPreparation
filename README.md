This repository contains a Packet Tracer personal project, conducted with the purpose of training for the 200-301 CCNA Certification Exam.
The project is a simulation of a small network and trains aspects like: Basic Device Configuration (hostname, passwords, encryption, MOTD Banner), OSPF Routing, IP Addressing , VLAN Configuration, ACL configuration, 
                                                                        Automatic DHCP, Web Server Configuration (basic Web Page Configuration), DNS Server Configuration, wireless AP Configuration (SSID, password).
The full requirements of the projects can be found in the Requirements.txt file.
5.ACL Conf explanation.png file is an extension for the Requirements.txt file and PacketTracerTopology.png displays the final topology.
In the future a network expansion is planned, introducing redundancy aspects like STP, FHRP, more security and many more features, so stay tuned for v2.
