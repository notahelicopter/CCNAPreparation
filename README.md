This repository contains a personal project made in Packet Tracer, conducted with the purpose of training for the 200-301 CCNA Certification Exam.
This project starts with the fundamental process of subnetting the network, and continues with more complicated aspects, such as configuring the VLANs on the switches or the OSPF Routing between the routers, restricting access with ACLs, or providing automatic IP Addressing capabilities through DHCP. The last part of the network is the extended network, which adds two servers, a Web Server and a DNS Server, and also an AP. The two servers are configured with basic features, and the AP is configured to connect the wireless guests to the network. The network has a complete connectivity, unless the rules applied by the ACLs, the servers and the AP are working fine, and most important, the network offers two fundamental erquirements of any network, the scalability and the redundancy.

As a future work, the network can be expanded even more, providing RADIUS or TACACS+ servers, used for addressing the security part of the network. Talking about security, a VPN connection can also be implemented when conecting to a remote network. Redundancy aspects also can be improved, offering layer 2 redundancy with multiple switches and STP or layer 3 redundancy with FHRP.
